# Route-Risk-Optimization
# 🚗 Road Route Risk Screening using Quantum Computing (QAOA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Quantum Computing** can be used to identify the **safest road route** using the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**.

The system evaluates multiple possible road routes simultaneously using quantum principles such as:

- Superposition
- Quantum Interference
- Hybrid Quantum–Classical Optimization

The objective is to select the route with **minimum risk**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

A vehicle must travel from **Home → Office**.

There are three available road segments:

| Road | Description | Risk Score |
|------|------------|------------|
| Road A | Highway | 5 |
| Road B | City Road | 2 |
| Road C | Inner Street | 1 |

Goal:

> Find the safest route (minimum risk) using Quantum Optimization.
